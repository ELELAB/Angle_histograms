The chi_histo_plot.py contains a function that can be used for plotting the 
histograms of dihedral angles from the gmx chi function whith a coloring 
over time.

It contains two main functions:
The plot:
def hisColum(filelists, bins=36.0, figsize=(11.96, 6), njumps=11, shift=0):
    """Takes ((file1_1,file1_2,..),(file2_1,file2_2,..),..) and plots 
    histograms of file1* over file2* over ...
    njumps: coarse-grainedness of the time-coloring
    bins: number of bins in histogram
    shift: shift of residuenumber in the label"""

And a helper function that plots for dir-names and the angles specified. 
(Only good for up to ~15 residues.)
def combined_plot(dir_names, angles=["phi", "psi", "chi1"], **kwargs):

You need to run gmx chi first to generate the input-files. Something like:
gmx_mpi chi -s $conf -f $traj -phi -psi -omega -all -maxchi 6

You can use this script for different sequences with an alignment file as well.
In the alignmen file the gap is '-'. If one of your sequence is shorter then 
the other than you should use ' ' where is no residue in the sequence. The
labels must be the same in the alignment file as it is in the config file. This
implies that you should separate the label and the sequenc with 'tab'.

NOTE: If you have more than one chain in the system it is nessecary to split
 the trajectory and conf file into seperate files and then run gmx chi
