The chi_histo_plot.py contains a function that can be used for plotting the 
histograms of dihedral angles from the gmx chi function whith a coloring 
over time.

It contains two main functions:
The plot:
def hisColum(filelists, bins=36.0, figsize=(11.96, 6), njumps=11, shift=0):
    """Takes ((file1_1,file1_2,..),(file2_1,file2_2,..),..) and plots 
    histograms of file1* over file2* over ...
    njumps: coarse-grainedness of the time-coloring
    bins: number of bins in histogram
    shift: shift of residuenumber in the label"""

And a helper function that plots for dir-names and the angles specified. 
(Only good for up to ~15 residues.)
def combined_plot(dir_names, angles=["phi", "psi", "chi1"], **kwargs):

You need to run gmx chi first to generate the input-files. Something like:
gmx_mpi chi -s $conf -f $traj -phi -psi -omega -all -maxchi 6

NOTE: If you have more than one chain in the system it is nessecary to split
 the trajectory and conf file into seperate files and then run gmx chi
